# Reverse an Array
<!-- Somethings you need to know before writing the function, value will not be null.
  There is no preference on if its a number or letter
  It should of also return the same array, not a new array *Vinicio made an exception for today's challenge.-->

## Challenge
<!-- Write a function that takes in array as an argument. Without any built in methods like .reverse, reverse the array. -->

## Solution
![Array Reverse]("array_Reverse.JPG") // I believe this is how you embed a photo?
