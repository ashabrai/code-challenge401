### Queue with Stacks
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ashabrai/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ashabrai/data-structures-and-algorithms)

### Challenge
Create a new queue class, using two stack instances. Using the following methods
enqueue and dequeue. And only use push and pop to remove and add things to the stack.
### Solution
Create a function that creates a constructor, with the constructor create the 
two stacks. And then create two functions enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue you are push to an array,
dequeue you are popping the value.
