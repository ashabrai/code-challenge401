#**Linked List With Recursion**

* With this assignment, we took a previous linked-list lab. And changed the remove method to incopperate recursion, than
using a normal loop.

## How to start
* First make sure your machine is running with NodeJs, if not go ahead and download it. 
You can find it online by typing 'download NodeJS'. 

* After that go a head and clone down the repo to have on your local machine.
* Once you have it open it up in whatever editing software you use.
* MAKE SURE ONCE YOU HAVE THE REPO, TYPE THIS IN YOUR TERMINAL 
    -**npm install** 

## Let's run some test! 
* You want to make sure your code is working fine and they're are no bugs.
* You'll see there are two tests that have been created 
    1. One to test that the value was removed.
    2. One to test if you have an empty list that you are trying to remove from.
* But once your ready to run your test 
* Simply run this command in your terminal npm run test.

*Example of what you'll see/need to run a test

const LinkedList = require('../lib/linked-list');

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    testNodeList.insertAtHead(`value ${i}`);
}
